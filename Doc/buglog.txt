Arduino String format in UDP printf:
	Problem: Tried to use UDP.printf("%s", my_string). Does not work when number of bytes is latger than 11.
	Solution: Use UDP.write() instead and typecast string to char* with c_str()
Serial:
	Problem: Serial does not finish printing before sleep
	Solution: Use Seria.flush() to make sure all data has been transmitted or received
Interrupt:
	ISR does not work with RFID_read
	Maybe the ISR is too long and uses too much space on stack
